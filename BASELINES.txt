To compute a baseline model, we used Support Vector Machine model.
Before applying this model, we divided the data into training and testing sets with 
80/20 split. 
We extract features for Cleaned Tweets using TF-IDF and Bag of Words.


In the base line model, ng

ram range of (1,3) which would consider unigram,bigram and trigram.

The baseline model accuracy using TF-IDF 64.5
The baseline model accuracy using Bag of Words 64.5
